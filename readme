Install Franka in folder
copy src folder and readme from this into the top level folder of the ros directory (where src, devel and build are)
Install the spacenav and 3dconnexion drivers to use spacemouse

To run on a real arm:
First, set up the arm and launch the controller. Make sure to run roscore if doing remotely.

Launch two terminal windows, in the first run:
roslaunch spacenav_node classic.launch
Then, in the second window, use
cd panda_sim
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/franka_ros/franka_mouse
python3 simulate.py

When the prompt appears, press n to start teleoperating, or r to run whatever path is stored in the 'run.txt' file.


Simulation of the panda arm with Spacemouse Teleoperation (requires franka_human_friendly_controllers from here: https://github.com/franzesegiovanni/franka_human_friendly_controllers)
Launch process:
Requires four terminal windows. Run these commands:
roscore
roslaunch spacenav_node classic.launch

Then cd into panda_sim and use
source devel/setup.bash
in both windows
in one, use
roslaunch franka_gazebo panda.launch x:=-0.5 world:=$(rospack find franka_gazebo)/world/stone.sdf controller:=cartesian_variable_impedance_controller rviz:=false load_gripper:=true
to launch the Simulation

Then, in the fourth window, use
cd panda_sim
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/franka_ros/franka_mouse
python3 simulate.py

Kill Gazebo with
killall -9 gazebo & killall -9 gzserver  & killall -9 gzclient
